Attribute Extraction from Web Documents.

Title: Simplified DOM Trees for Transferable Attribute Extraction from the Web
Url : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02415.pdf

Keywords: structured data extraction, web information extraction, Simplified DOM

Implementation is in pytorch.

Trained weights on SWDE dataset (auto- vertical) are available here - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DMH8mMEnRkDarrZFyY34ZsURiMN9Pg5v/view?usp=sharing

In order to execute test.ipynb notebook, download the file and unzip in "data" folder.

To re-train the model on other verticals of SWDE dataset use train.ipynb notebook.
